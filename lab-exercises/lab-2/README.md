Implement a Status Code Response

Using any Node core library and/or web framework, create an HTTP server that meets the following criteria:
- Listens on localhost
- Listens on port 3000
- Responds to HTTP GET requests to `/` with a 200 OK HTTP status (the content can be anything)
- Responds to HTTP POST requests to `/` with a 405 Method Not Allowed HTTP status
